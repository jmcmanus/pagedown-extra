  "description": "This is a collection of Pagedown plugins to enable support for Markdown Extra syntax. Open demo/demo.html to try it yourself. To run the tests, just open spec/SpecRunner.html in your browser. Or, to run a browser-less test from the command line as travis-ci would, run bundle install followed by bundle exec rake. You'll need Ruby and the rake gem if you use the second method.",
